This Google Collab tutorial has not only taught you about Datalog's syntax and semantics, but you've also seen firsthand the elegance and logical depth this language provides for accessing and managing relational databases. We began with the fundamentals—defining simple relationships—and progressed to more complicated structures such as stratified negation, demonstrating Datalog's ability to handle intricate logical queries efficiently.\n",

        "This journey provided you the tools you need to think logically and structurally about data relationships, with a focus on clarity and precision in rule-based data manipulation. The exercises demonstrated how Datalog can speed complex queries including recursive relationships and conditional logic, making it a valuable tool for any data professional or researcher.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you continue to improve your data querying skills, keep in mind Datalog's fundamental ideas and the methodical approach to problem solving that it encourages. Whether you're working with enormous datasets or complex data structures, the techniques covered here will help you create more efficient and trustworthy database searches. Continue experimenting with different scenarios and incorporating Datalog ideas into your projects to fully realise the potential of this strong logic programming language. Thank you for joining me on this educational voyage; may your future efforts be smart and data-driven!"
